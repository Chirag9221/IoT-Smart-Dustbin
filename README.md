IoT-Smart-Trash-Bin

**The repository has two files.**
1. One has Arduino code for automatically opening a dustbin using Arduino, an Infrared Sensor, and a Servo Motor (SG 90).
2. The second file contains code for NodeMCU ESP8266, using an ultrasonic sensor and NodeMCU to monitor garbage levels. Real-time monitoring is done through the Blynk App.
